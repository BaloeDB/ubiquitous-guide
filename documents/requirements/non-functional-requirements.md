Sure, here are the non-functional requirements for the Event Management System project:

**Performance**:
- The system should be able to handle multiple users at the same time.
- The response time for all operations should be reasonable and provide a smooth user experience.

**Security**:
- User data should be stored securely.
- Passwords should be hashed and not stored in plain text.
- The system should prevent SQL injection and other common security vulnerabilities.

**Scalability**:
- The system should be designed in a way that it can handle an increase in users without a significant decrease in performance.

**Reliability**:
- The system should be reliable and available for use most of the time.
- The system should handle errors gracefully and not crash.

**Usability**:
- The user interface should be intuitive and easy to use.
- The system should provide clear error messages.

**Maintainability**:
- The code should be well-structured and easy to understand.
- The system should be easy to update and maintain.

**Portability**:
- The system should work across different platforms and browsers.

Remember, these are just the basic non-functional requirements. Depending on the complexity and additional features of your project, you might need to add more. Happy coding! ðŸ˜Š
