**Software Engineering Principles**:

1. **SOLID Principles**: These are five principles of object-oriented programming that make your code more understandable, flexible, and maintainable.
   - **S**ingle Responsibility Principle
   - **O**pen/Closed Principle
   - **L**iskov Substitution Principle
   - **I**nterface Segregation Principle
   - **D**ependency Inversion Principle

2. **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: This principle aims to reduce the repetition of code.

3. **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)**: This principle states that most systems work best if they are kept simple rather than made complicated.

4. **YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)**: This principle states that a programmer should not add functionality until deemed necessary.

**Project Management Techniques**:

1. **Agile**: Agile project management is an iterative approach to delivering a project throughout its life cycle.

2. **Scrum**: Scrum is a framework within which people can address complex adaptive problems, while productively and creatively delivering products of the highest possible value.

3. **Kanban**: Kanban is a visual system for managing work as it moves through a process. Kanban visualizes both the process (the workflow) and the actual work passing through that process.

**Design Techniques**:
1. **SMART Goals**: SMART is an acronym that stands for Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. When setting a goal, ensure that it is:
- **Specific**: Your goal should be clear, focused, and concise.
- **Measurable**: You should be able to track your progress and know when the goal has been achieved.
- **Achievable**: Your goal should be realistic and attainable.
- **Relevant**: Your goal should align with your project's overall objectives.
- **Time-bound**: Your goal should have a specific time frame in which it will be achieved.

2. **User Personas**: User personas are fictional characters created to represent the different user types that might use your app in a similar way. Creating personas will help you to understand your usersâ€™ needs, experiences, behaviors and goals.

3. **User Stories**: User stories are a simple way to capture user requirements throughout a project. An effective user story can help to create a simplified description of a requirement.

4. **Wireframes**: Wireframing is a way to design a website service at the structural level. A wireframe is commonly used to lay out content and functionality on a page which takes into account user needs and user journeys.
