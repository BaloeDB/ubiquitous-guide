**1. Authentication**:
- Implement user registration and login using Spring Security in your backend.
- Store passwords securely using hashing algorithms like BCrypt.
- Generate a JSON Web Token (JWT) upon successful login and send it to the frontend.
- The frontend should store this token (preferably in HttpOnly cookies) and attach it to the Authorization header in subsequent requests.

**2. Authorization**:
- Protect your endpoints using Spring Security. Only authenticated users should be able to access protected resources.
- Implement role-based access control if necessary. For example, only the user who created an event should be able to update or delete it.

**3. Data Validation**:
- Validate all user inputs both on the client side (React) and server side (Spring Boot) to prevent attacks like SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).
- Use prepared statements or ORM to avoid SQL injection.

**4. CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)**:
- Configure CORS in Spring Boot to restrict which domains can access your backend.

**5. HTTPS**:
- Use HTTPS for all communication between the frontend and backend to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.

**6. Security Headers**:
- Set security headers like Content Security Policy (CSP), HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS), and X-Content-Type-Options to protect against various attacks.
