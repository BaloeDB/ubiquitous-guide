**Components**: These are your React components. They define the structure of your UI and use services to fetch data.

**Services**: These are functions that interact with your backend APIs. They are used by your components to fetch data, post data, etc.

**State (Redux Store)**: This is where you store your application state. It's accessible to all your components.

**Hooks**: These are built-in React functions that let you use state and other React features.

**API (axios)**: This is the library you use to make HTTP requests to your backend.

**Actions**: These are functions that dispatch actions to update your Redux store.
